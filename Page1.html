<p style="font-size: 25px;color: green">Many Vehicle states are specific to each Vehicle object, e.g., on/off, driver in
seat, fuel remaining. Other states are specific to the class of Vehicles, not any
particular Vehicle (e.g., keeping track of the “last” Vehicle ID # assigned).
These correspond to instance fields and static fields in a class.</p>
